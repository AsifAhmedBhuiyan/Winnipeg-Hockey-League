# Winnipeg-Hockey-League

I created the ultimate Hockey Stats Tracking App. I used Object Oriented Programming to create an initial version
of the app according to the following specifications.

 The app keep track of : - Games played - Wins - Losses - Shots on goal - Points scored

I used to track additional information to calculate some of the required statistics described below.

Points for teams are awarded as follows:

Win: 2 points
Tie: 1 point
Loss: 0 points
Points for players are awarded as follows:

Goal: 2 points
Assist: 1 point
An assist is when a player directly contributes to scoring a goal, but doesn't take the actual scoring shot. 
A goal may have up to two assisting players.
Statistics for teams:

Wins
Losses
Ties
Points
Goals for: This is the cumulative number of goals they've scored against opposing teams across all their games.
Goals against: This is the cumulative number of goals opposing teams have scored against them across all their games.

Statics for players:
Points
Determined by goals and assists
Shots on goal
Total, regardless of if they successfully score
Statistics for goalies only:

Save percentage (number of saves divided by total shots on goal)

Game Play
A game consists of each team taking shots on goal with the outcome of each shot being random. 
The team with the most goals wins the game. If both teams have the same number of goals, 
the game is considered a tie.
